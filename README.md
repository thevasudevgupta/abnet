# Incorporating BERT into Parallel Sequence Decoding with Adapters

This is my implementation of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06138).

## Setting Up

```python
# preparing data 
cd data/iwslt14
bash prepare-iwslt14.sh

```

**Feel free to raise an issue incase you find any problems in this implementation.**
